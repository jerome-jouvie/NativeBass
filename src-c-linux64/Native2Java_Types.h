 * INTRODUCTION
 * BASS is an audio library for use in Windows and Mac OSX software.
 * Its purpose is to provide developers with the most powerful and
 * efficient (yet easy to use), sample, stream (MP3, MP2, MP1, OGG, WAV, AIFF,
 * custom generated, and more via add-ons), MOD music (XM, IT, S3M, MOD, MTM, UMX),
 * MO3 music (MP3/OGG compressed MODs),
 * and recording functions. All in a tiny DLL, under 100KB* in size.
